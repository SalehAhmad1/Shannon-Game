# Shannon-Game
This repository contains an implementation of a probabilistic language model for predicting the next word in the Shannon game using n-grams.

# Introduction
The Shannon game is a task that involves predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The goal is to build a language model that can accurately estimate the probability of different words 
occurring next based on the previous n-gram sequence.
